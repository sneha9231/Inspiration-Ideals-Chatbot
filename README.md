## 🌍 Project Overview

Our goal is to create a chatbot that can answer user questions with thoughtful, motivational responses drawn directly from the book "Inspiration and Ideals." The chatbot is designed to be a daily source of inspiration, offering guidance and encouragement tailored to each user's queries.

## 🚀 Progress Update (May 2025)

### ✅ Achievements

- **Book Digitization:**  
  Processed 100% of the book’s content, covering all 365 daily entries, using Azure Studio.
- **Platform Evaluation:**  
  Compared Power Apps and Azure Studio to identify the best platform for our needs.
- **Data Structuring:**  
  Gathered and formatted the latest versions of entries (including those curated on Substack) for chatbot integration.
- **Database Integration:**  
  Currently integrating the book’s content into Power Automate to serve as the chatbot’s backend knowledge base.

### 💡 Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Collection & Format:**  
  The book’s entries needed to be curated and formatted for consistency. We explored storing the data in Word, Excel, and other formats to optimize for chatbot use.
- **Language Adaptation:**  
  Since the original text (from 1917) reflects a Christian perspective, we refined and adapted the language to ensure inclusivity and cultural relevance for a diverse audience, while preserving the book’s core themes of ambition, perseverance, and faith.
- **Technical Integration:**  
  We are currently working on routing the processed book content through Power Virtual Agents to enable seamless, conversational interactions.
